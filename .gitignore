# The current application UI state (DOM layout, recently-opened files, etc.) is
# stored in these files (separate for desktop and mobile) so you can resume
# your session seamlessly after a restart. If you want to track UI state, use
# the Workspaces core plugin instead of relying on these files.

# Obsidian plugins are stored under .obsidian/plugins/$plugin_name. They
# contain metadata (manifest.json), application code (main.js), stylesheets
# (styles.css), and user-configuration data (data.json).
# We want to exclude all plugin-related files, so we can exclude everything
# under this directory.
